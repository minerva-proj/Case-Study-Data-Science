# Overview of the Coursework

The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms for detecting fake notes. A fake note is a counterfeit currency note that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. The problem of fake note detection is important because it helps to prevent the circulation of fake notes, which can cause economic harm to individuals and society as a whole.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Fake Note Detection" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1372 instances and 5 attributes. The attributes are:

*Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
*Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
*Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
*Entropy of image (continuous)
*Class (binary, 1 for fake and 0 for genuine)
