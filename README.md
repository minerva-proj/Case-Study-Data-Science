# Overview of the Coursework

The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms for detecting fake notes. A fake note is a counterfeit currency note that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. The problem of fake note detection is important because it helps to prevent the circulation of fake notes, which can cause economic harm to individuals and society as a whole.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Fake Note Detection" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1372 instances and 5 attributes. The attributes are:

* Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* Entropy of image (continuous)
* Class (binary, 1 for fake and 0 for genuine)

# Preprocessing
Before the data is used to train the machine learning models, it must be preprocessed. This includes splitting the data into training and test sets, and possibly performing feature scaling.

# Machine Learning Models
The following supervised machine learning algorithms will be compared in this project:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Naive Bayes

#Evaluation
The performance of each machine learning model will be evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The model with the highest average performance across all metrics will be considered the best model for fake note detection.

# Conclusion
The results of the comparison will be summarized and discussed in the conclusion, along with any suggestions for further work.
